    Hello everyone! My name is Alma Erden. I am originally from Albania and currently live in Ames, Iowa. For more than ten years, I taught Turkish as a Second Language to high school students in Albania and Kosovo and held different administrative roles in education settings. I have enjoyed the opportunity to live and work in four different countries. Currently, I am working toward my Master`s degree in Learning Design and Technology with a certification in User Experience and Usability.
    I have no previous experience with web design and development. At the end of this course, I expect to know the basics of HTML and CSS. I hope to use those skills in the future to develop engaging learning experiences for adult learners. 
    My favorite hobby is cooking healthy food. I enjoy reading and spending time outside with my family in my free time.
