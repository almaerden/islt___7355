    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Alma Erden. I am originally from Albania, a small European country. I live in Ames, a quiet city in Iowa. 
    I have always been passionate about learning and education. I attended the University of Tirana in Albania in 2000. I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree in Turkish as a Second Language Specialist. Currently, I am working toward my Master of Science degree in Learning Technologies and Design with a certification in User Experience and Usability at the University of Missouri-Colombia.
    <br/> I taught Turkish as a Second Language in high schools for over ten years and held different administrative roles in educational settings. I feel fortunate that I had the opportunity to teach in three different countries: Albania, Turkey, and Kosovo. This experience has given me a new perspective on different cultures and the various contexts in which education and learning occur.
    One of my top priorities in my teaching career has been to promote an <strong>inclusive</strong> learning  environment that encourages students' <em>academic</em> and <em>personal</em> growth.</p>
